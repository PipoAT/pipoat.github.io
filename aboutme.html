            <p>Hello, I am Andrew Pipo, a third-year student here at the University of Cincinnati pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Information Technology. Currently, I am transitioning from a co-op to a part-time position as an Embedded Software Engineer at a company down in Walton, Kentucky called ATech Training. My specialization within the company lies in the research and development of internal web applications and software.</p>
            <p>During this upcoming summer, I will be taking a full load of classes to further my education. These courses will be a mix of both major-related and minor-related subjects. Alongside my academic and work commitments, I enjoy spending time with friends and family. We engage in various outdoor activities like bike riding, attending football and baseball games, golfing, putt-putt, and bowling. Additionally, we also enjoy indoor activities such as board and video game nights. If you have any tips or tricks to help me beat my friends in Mario Kart, I would greatly appreciate them!</p>
            <p>Outside of that, I have been a trombone player for 10 years to which I was participating in marching, pep, symphonic, jazz, and concert bands throughout middle and high school. Additionally, I have travelled across the midwest and even into Texas, the Carolinas, Florida, and even have been out of the country in the Bahamas and Canada on several occasions.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, this summer will likely be my busiest semester yet as I have recently moved into an apartment for the next year and as of now coursework has been steady these first few weeks. However, I am determined to have a great time and make this semester one to remember!</p>
